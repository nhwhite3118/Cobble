<h2> Cobbler </h2>
<p>
Cobbler is intended to be to vanilla minecraft what peach cobbler is to ice cream. It is not meant to fundimentally change the experience of vanilla minecraft, but rather to compliment it by opening up the possibilities of creating more farms and making more resources renewable. Cobbler should ultimately keep the same spirit of the vanilla game, but add more things for the more technical players to do.

This mod is in the very early stages of development, and since it is the first minecraft mod that I am creating, it is likely that some of the intended features may be better suited to datapacks.
