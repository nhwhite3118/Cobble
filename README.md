# Cobbler

Cobbler is intended to be to vanilla minecraft what peach cobbler is to ice cream. It is not meant to fundimentally change the experience of vanilla minecraft, but rather to compliment it by opening up the possibilities of creating more farms and making more resources renewable. Cobbler should ultimately keep the same spirit of the vanilla game, but add more things for the more technical players to do.

I do not plan on making any items which can be farmed fully afk any easier to farm. Some semi-automatically farmable items will be given methods to be fully automatic, and some non-renewable resources will only be given semi-afkable farming methods depending on the usefullness of the resource. I will also try to avoid adding farms for items which will become farmable in availible snapshots. For example, at the time of writing, gravel is to become renewable in version 1.16, so I will not be adding a way to farm gravel (although I really like the idea of silverfish converting stone to gravel). 

This mod is in the very early stages of development, and since it is the first minecraft mod that I am creating, it is likely that some of the intended features may be better suited to datapacks. 

## Finished Features
- Bonemealing grass now has a small chance to spawn an oak sapling, making fully automatic wood farms possible.

## Planned Features
- Make spiders spawn cobwebs under certain conditions, making cowbebs able to be farmed semi-automatically.
- Make sapplings convert to dead bushes under certain conditions, making them able to be farmed semi-automatically.
- Add shulker respawn mechanic with high diffulculty to farm. Possibly spawn reinforcements in adjacent end cities, or respawn shulkers after some event.
- Add difficult way to obtain more dragon eggs. Possibly double ender dragon fight.
- Make cocoa fully automatically farmable. Possibly allow endermen to pickup and place. It would be unusual in that endermen do not currently interact with crops, but since they are most likely of the same race as the player, they could remember liking chocolate. Villagers would be the obvious choice, but many resources can already be farmed by farmer villagers, and this would be trivial to farm since they have no reason to pick up cocoa.
