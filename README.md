# Shulker's Faithful Factories

Shulker's Faithful Factories is not meant to fundimentally change the experience of vanilla minecraft, but rather to compliment it by opening up the possibilities of creating more farms and making more resources renewable. It should ultimately keep the same spirit of the vanilla game, but add more things for the more technical players to do.

I do not plan on making any items which can be farmed fully afk any easier to farm. Some semi-automatically farmable items will be given methods to be fully automatic, and some non-renewable resources will only be given semi-afkable farming methods depending on the usefullness of the resource.

The master branch will always be the latest stable version. As of this update to the README, it is on minecraft version 1.16.1. Any commits to the 1.16.1 branch which are ahead of master should be considered as in-progress and are not guarenteed to be stable. Branches for old versions of minecraft will not keep feature parity with the latest version, and I only plan to make critical updates to them if major bugs are discovered. If you wish to contribute to any version I will gladly review any pull requests which are made. 

## Downloads
I will be posting new versions semi-regularly on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cobbler). You can find the latest stable version along with previous stable versions there. Then you just need to add the cobbler<versionNumber>.jar file to your mods folder and you're good to go. If this is your first time installing a mod, you will most likely want to follow the instructions found [here.](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mods/Installing_Forge_mods)

## Finished Features
- Added Shulker Factories - an extremely rare structure in the end towering above the surrounding landscape with a series of randomly generated platforms guarded by shulkers, and containing items left by the creators of shulkers.
  - Contains one shulker spawner each at the top
  - Randomly generated loot with a rare chance of items such as dragon eggs and enchanted elytra
  - Lore-rich structure with details of its design which hint at how and why the shulkers were created
- Bonemealing grass now has a small chance to spawn an oak sapling, making fully automatic wood farms possible.
- Saplings now have chance to convert to dead bushes instead of becoming a tree in the desert depending on light level. This makes dead bushes renewable, and in conjunction with the change causing bonemeal to rarely create saplings, a semi-automatic farm should be possible, if difficult. Fully automatic farms would not currently be possible since dispensers can't shear dead bushes. 
- Spiders will spin cobwebs on trees, spawners, and other cobwebs in dim light.
- Endermen can break and plant cocoa.

## Planned Features
- Improve Shulker Factories
