# Cobbler

Cobbler is intended to be to vanilla minecraft what peach cobbler is to ice cream. It is not meant to fundimentally change the experience of vanilla minecraft, but rather to compliment it by opening up the possibilities of creating more farms and making more resources renewable. Cobbler should ultimately keep the same spirit of the vanilla game, but add more things for the more technical players to do.

I do not plan on making any items which can be farmed fully afk any easier to farm. Some semi-automatically farmable items will be given methods to be fully automatic, and some non-renewable resources will only be given semi-afkable farming methods depending on the usefullness of the resource.

## Downloads
I will be posting new versions semi-regularly on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cobbler). You can find the latest stable version along with previous stable versions there. Then you just need to add the cobbler<versionNumber>.jar file to your mods folder and you're good to go. If this is your first time installing a mod, you will most likely want to follow the instructions found [here.](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mods/Installing_Forge_mods)

## Finished Features
- Added Shulker Factories - an extremely rare structure in the end towering above the surrounding landscape with a series of randomly generated platforms guarded by shulkers, and containing items left by the creators of shulkers.
  - Contains one shulker spawner each at the top
  - Randomly generated loot with a rare chance of items such as dragon eggs and enchanted elytra
  - Lore-rich structure with details of its design which hint at how and why the shulkers were created
- Bonemealing grass now has a small chance to spawn an oak sapling, making fully automatic wood farms possible.
- Saplings now have chance to convert to dead bushes instead of becoming a tree in the desert depending on light level. This makes dead bushes renewable, and in conjunction with the change causing bonemeal to rarely create saplings, a semi-automatic farm should be possible, if difficult. Fully automatic farms would not currently be possible since dispensers can't shear dead bushes. 

## Planned Features
- Make spiders spawn cobwebs under certain conditions, making cowbebs able to be farmed semi-automatically.
- Make cocoa fully automatically farmable. Possibly allow endermen to pickup and place. It would be unusual in that endermen do not currently interact with crops, but since they are most likely of the same race as the player, they could remember liking chocolate. Villagers would be the obvious choice, but many resources can already be farmed by farmer villagers, and this would be trivial to farm since they have no reason to pick up cocoa.
