Shulkers Faithful Factories is not meant to fundamentally change the experience of vanilla minecraft, but rather to compliment it by 
opening up the possibilities of creating more farms and making more resources renewable. 
Shulkers Faithful Factories should ultimately keep the same spirit of the vanilla game, but add more things for the more technical players to do. 
Some semi-automatically farmable items will be given methods to be fully automatic, 
and some non-renewable resources will only be given semi-afkable farming methods depending on the usefulness of the resource.
